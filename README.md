# The Ultimate Car-quiz

Creating a quiz

## Landing Page -

Tab for scoreboard
 - once clicked the page reloads and displays all the local data saved

    - need to declare players score in local storage 
    - need to call in all that stored data

Timer: 
- create a timer which can will count down and lose value as the user inouts the wrong value
    - need to create a loop function which will allow the the timer to go down every second.
      - Maybe start with 100 seconds and every wrong anwser takes away ten seconds

Main Content; 
 - Create a button that begins the quiz., Probably need to attatch an event listner to it
  - Html Header saying that is a Car quiz 
  - More html and css styling under it describing the game and the game rules that go along with it.
